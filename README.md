## Description

The goal of this project is to provide a platform for content creators to share and connect with their readers. The web page provides a mix of free and premium. It gives the user a taste of what the writer has to offer.

#### For the content manager, the platform provides:

* **A blog section** — Content creator can regularly release articles, control the accessibility (free, registered or premium). Add a topic and extra tags, correlate articles with other site content. 
* **A virtual classroom** — Content creator can publish recorded video classes or as part of the full course, limiting access to the public.
* **Course path** — As a content manager, the site provides the ability to group the content (articles, classes) into a single course path, to help guide users to mastering the content. 


#### There are three options for the users to explore the content:

* **Anonymous access**, user can read all free articles and related discussion 
* **Registered user**, provides access to all free content. The user has its personal space with a list of favorite content and saved notes; Once registered, the user can also buy courses on demand. 
* **Premium access**, monthly subscription model. Unlock access to all the site content for as long as the subscription lasts.

#### The pricing model and Value to the Content Owner:

While selling his premium content, a site owner can connect to his public, understanding their needs and doubt and ever evolving this content. Provides different access to content, by selling single courses for more advanced users and also more guided course paths to beginners. All that while creating a distinct brand for content.

#### The value for the user:

By providing different levels of access to content, the Learning Hub platform has something for every user. As a registered user, she enjoys a whole set of features that will allow her to develop new skills. Taking her time to select the premium content that has most value to her.

## User Experience (UX)
-   ### User stories
    [UserStories.md](UserStories.md)
-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are Code Insititue red, and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.
